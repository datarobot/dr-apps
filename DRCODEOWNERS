# This file defines which domain owns what parts of this repository.
# This repository is a central place for defining Jenkins Jobs and Jarvis Suites to orchestrate
# build and test workflows for pull requests and pipelines.  As such, it is expected
# that this repository will have many owners and some shared areas (reusable macros, etc.)
#
# Please see DataRobot repo ./tools/code_owners.py tool to find which particular file
# or directory is owned by what domain.
#
# Default owners for everything in the repo.
# Unless a later match takes precedence, these groups will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.
