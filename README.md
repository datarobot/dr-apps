# Custom apps hosting in DataRobot with DRApps

DRApps is a simple command line interface (CLI) providing the tools required to 
host a custom application, such as a Streamlit app, in DataRobot using a DataRobot 
execution environment. This allows you to run apps without building your own docker 
image. Custom applications don't provide any storage; however, you can access the 
full DataRobot API and other services.

## Install the DRApps CLI tool

### For users

``` sh
pip install git+https://github.com/datarobot/dr-apps
```

### For contributors

To install the DRApps CLI tool, clone this 
respository and then install package by running the following command:

``` sh 
python setup.py install
```

## For Windows Users

For Windows users, you may need to interface with the DR Custom Apps CLI via module calls:

```sh
python -m drapps <your_commands_here>
```
If you have issues entering words with spaces ( eg: `-e "[Experimental] Python 3.9 Streamlit"` )
then you may find that using ids is a little easier.

## Use the DRApps CLI

After you install the DRApps CLI tool, you can use the `--help` command to 
access the following information:

``` sh
$ drapps --help
Usage: drapps [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  CLI tools for custom applications.

  You can use drapps COMMAND --help for getting more info about command.

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  create     Creates new custom application from docker image or base...
  logs       Provides logs for custom application.
  ls         Provides list of custom applications or execution environments.
  terminate  Stops custom application and removes it from the list.
```
You can use `--help` for each command separately for each command

### Create custom application
``` sh
$ drapps create --help
Usage: drapps create [OPTIONS] APPLICATION_NAME

  Creates new custom application from docker image or base environment.

  If application created from project folder, custom application image will be
  created or existing will be updated.

                        DATAROBOT_API_TOKEN env instead.
  -E, --endpoint TEXT   Data Robot Public API endpoint. You can use
                        DATAROBOT_ENDPOINT instead. Default:
                        https://app.datarobot.com/api/v2
  -e, --base-env TEXT   Name or ID for execution environment.
  -p, --path DIRECTORY  Path to folder with files that should be uploaded.
  -i, --image FILE      Path to tar archive with custom application docker

## Deploy an example app

To test this, deploy an example Streamlit app using the following command from 
the root directory of this repo:

``` sh
drapps create -t <your_api_token> -e "[Experimental] Python 3.9 Streamlit" -p ./demo-streamlit DemoApp
```

This example script works as follows:

1. Finds the execution environment through the `/api/v2/executionEnvironments/` 
endpoint by the name or UUID you provided, verifying if the environment can be 
used for the custom application and retrieving the ID of the latest environment version.

2. Finds or creates the custom application image through the `/api/v2/customApplicationImages/` 
endpoint, named by adding the `Image` suffix to the provided application name (i.e., `CustomApp Image`).

3. Creates a new version of a custom application image through the `customApplicationImages/<appImageId>/versions` 
endpoint, uploading all files from the directory you provided and setting the execution 
environment version defined in the first step.

4. Starts a new application with the custom application image version created 
in the previous step.

When this script runs successfully, link to it appears 
in the terminal. Also, you can access the application on the DataRobot 
Applications tab [Non EU DataRobot](https://app.datarobot.com/applications) [EU DataRobot](https://app.eu.datarobot.com/applications).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To access the application, you must be logged into the DataRobot instance and 
> account associated with the application.

## Considerations

Consider the following when creating a custom app:

* The root directory of the custom application must contain a `start-app.sh` file, 
used as the entry point for starting your application server.

* The web server of the application must listen on port `8080`.

* The required packages must be listed in a `requirements.txt` file in the application's 
root directory for automatic installation during application setup.

* The application should authenticate with the DataRobot API through the `DATAROBOT_API_TOKEN`  environment variable with a key found under `Developer Tools` on the DataRobot UI. The DataRobot package on PyPi already authenticates this way. This environment variable will automatically be added to your running container by the custom apps service.

* The application should access the DataRobot Public API URL for the current environment through the `DATAROBOT_ENDPOINT` environment variable. The DataRobot package on PyPi already uses this route. This environment variable will automatically be added to your running container by the custom apps service
